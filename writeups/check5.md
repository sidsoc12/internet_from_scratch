This checkpoint took me about 6 hours to do. I did attend the lab session.

Program Structure and Design of the NetworkInterface [Describe data
structures and approach taken. Describe alternative designs considered
or tested.  Describe benefits and weaknesses of your design compared
with alternatives -- perhaps in terms of simplicity/complexity, risk
of bugs, asymptotic performance, empirical performance, required
implementation time and difficulty, and other factors. Include any
measurements if applicable.]:

The core of my implementation relies on an unordered_map<uint32_t, pair<EthernetAddress, size_t>> for the ARP cache, which stores IP-to-Ethernet mappings along with a timestamp for expiration. I used unordered_map instead of map because ARP lookups need to be fast (constant time on average), and ordering isnâ€™t necessary. Each entry is removed after 30 seconds, so the time value helps keep track of when mappings should be purged. For ARP request timing, I used a separate unordered_map<uint32_t, size_t> to track when ARP requests were last sent. This prevents redundant requests within a 5-second window. The strategy was to coordinate between lookups amongst these two maps throughout the code. 

For handling datagrams waiting on ARP resolution, I used a std::vector<std::pair<uint32_t, InternetDatagram>>, where each entry stores the next-hop IP and the datagram that needs to be sent once the MAC address is learned. A queue might have worked, but a vector is better here because it allows efficient iteration and removal when an ARP reply arrives. Mainly I wanted to use a vector so that I could quickly iterate through the different datagrams that should be sent or discarded when new ARP info comes in. I could have used a std::deque for efficient popping, but the number of pending datagrams should be small, and a vector avoids the overhead of a more complex data structure. When an ARP reply is received, I iterate through the vector to find all datagrams waiting on that address, send them out, and remove them. This keeps things simple without needing an extra map.

For time tracking, I used a tick() function that decrements all stored timestamps. The ARP cache timestamps count down from 30 seconds, and when any entry hits zero, it gets erased. The ARP request tracker follows a similar logic, where entries count down from 5 seconds, and once they expire, new requests can be sent if needed. An alternative would have been counting up to 3000 or counting up to 5 but I decided on counting down.
