I would like to credit/thank these classmates for their help: [list sunetids here]

This lab took me about [5] hours to do. I did attend the lab session.

My secret code from section 2.1 was: 185776

I was surprised by or edified to learn that: the socket is really just a file descriptor associated with a ip/port address mapped by the OS. 

Describe ByteStream implementation. [Describe data structures and
approach taken. Describe alternative designs considered or tested.
Describe benefits and weaknesses of your design compared with
alternatives -- perhaps in terms of simplicity/complexity, risk of
bugs, asymptotic performance, empirical performance, required
implementation time and difficulty, and other factors. Include any
measurements if applicable.]

My ByteStream implementation uses a std::vector<char> as the underlying buffer to store the stream of bytes, along with state variables like capacity_, is_closed_, total_bytes_pushed, and total_bytes_popped to track the stream's size, state, and usage metrics. I chose std::vector<char> because it provides a simple, efficient, and well-tested way to manage a dynamic array of bytes. Data is added using std::vector::insert, and bytes are removed using erase. While erase incurs a linear time cost for shifting elements, I prioritized simplicity and maintainability since the buffer is designed for small to medium-sized workloads where this tradeoff is acceptable. I considered alternatives, like using std::deque. Deque would allow for constant-time removal of elements from the front, which could improve performance for frequent pop operations. However, these designs add complexity, and the benefits didnâ€™t outweigh the simplicity of sticking with std::vector<char>. I also ensured that the implementation tracks the state of the stream explicitly, with is_closed_ signaling when no more bytes can be written, and error_ indicating invalid operations. Overall, while std::vector<char> isn't the most efficient choice for very high-throughput usecases, it allowed me to implement the functionality quickly and with minimal risk of bugs
